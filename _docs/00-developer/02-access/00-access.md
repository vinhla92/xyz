The client application can be accessed in most modern browser.

Default access is public and user will _not_ be required to register and provide login credentials for the client interface or API.

However, the zero config workspace may not be modified without administrative access.

**Changing the access level in the** [**environment settings**](../../environment_settings/access-control/) **to private** will require user to register and provide login credentials.

Private and admin user accounts are stored in a PostgreSQL [**Access Control List \(ACL\)**](../acl).
